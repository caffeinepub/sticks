  "summary": "The diff implements a complete order management system with customer/seller portals, authentication via Internet Identity, user profiles, admin access control, order placement/completion, and stock management. The BuildRequest has no explicit requirements (none listed), only constraints and non-goals. Since there are no requirements to verify against, there are no missing requirements. However, the diff implements substantial features that were not requested in the BuildRequest (which is essentially empty). These include authentication, user profiles, admin checks, order management, and stock control systems.",
