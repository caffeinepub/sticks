# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build the initial StickSmart application - a complete order management system for selling custom sticks with a warm, earthy design aesthetic.

**Planned changes:**
- Create backend order management system in main.mo with order creation, retrieval, and status updates
- Implement hardcoded seller authentication system
- Build customer-facing product browsing and ordering interface
- Create seller dashboard for viewing and managing orders
- Design UI with warm, earthy color theme (terracotta, amber, sage green)
- Set up Internet Identity integration for authentication

**User-visible outcome:** Customers can browse stick products and place orders with customization options. The seller can log in with hardcoded credentials to view all orders, update order statuses, and manage the order pipeline through a dedicated dashboard.
